- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hertucktor on Github
- 👀 I’m interested in DevOps, software/system architecture and finding the golden ticket to not fall over my own technical debt
- 🌱 I’m always open for trying new stuff and learning from others
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all kinds of nerdy projects preferable on magic the gathering or dungeons and dragons related stuff  
- 📫 How to reach me is easy, via github or my e-mail
